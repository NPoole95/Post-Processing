This third year assignment involved producing a number of different post processing effects in both full screen and specific areas of the scene.
For this assignment we were given a shell project which allowed single post processing effects to be placed on the full screen.

I then added a number of different post processing effects. On top of this the implementation was also extended to allow 
multiple post processing effects to be placed on top of each other to allow for unique effects. I also added the option to 
place post processing effects on areas of the scene instead of simply being a full screen filter.

I also added the ImGui library to the project to allow me to add a user interface to the user can easily control not only 
what effects are placed on the scene, but their individual variables, allowing further customisation of the effects.

A link to a video demonstrating the project can be found in a text document in the repository.
